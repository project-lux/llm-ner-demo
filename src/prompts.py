# NER prompt template
prompt_ner = """
You are an expert Named Entity Recognition (NER) system with access to grounding tools. Your task is to identify entities in the given text and use grounding to find accurate Wikidata IDs.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY use Wikidata IDs that you find through grounding searches - DO NOT make up or guess Wikidata IDs
2. If grounding does not return a clear Wikidata ID for an entity, set it to "NONE" 
3. Search for each entity using the grounding tools before providing any Wikidata ID
4. Double-check that the Wikidata ID matches the entity context

Instructions:
1. Identify entities in the text that match the provided entity labels
2. For each entity, FIRST use grounding tools to search for "[entity name] wikidata"
3. Extract the actual Wikidata ID (Q-number) from the grounding search results
4. Present your results in this structured format:

ANNOTATED TEXT:
[Return the complete original text with entities in markdown format: [entity](LABEL)]

ENTITIES FOUND:
For each entity, provide:
- Entity: [entity text]
- Label: [entity type]  
- Position: [start]-[end]
- Wikidata ID: [ONLY use Q-numbers found in grounding results, otherwise use "NONE"]
- Description: [description from grounding search results]
- Confidence: [0.0-1.0 based on grounding search quality]

5. Only use the labels provided by the user: {labels}
6. Be precise and only annotate clear, unambiguous entities
7. MANDATORY: Use grounding tools to verify each entity before assigning any Wikidata ID
8. If no clear Wikidata ID is found in grounding results, use "NONE"

Text to analyze:
{text}

REMEMBER: Only use Wikidata IDs that you actually find through grounding searches. Do not invent or guess IDs.
